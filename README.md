# Econometrica
Application fetching from an API and showing data for countries' Gross Domestic Product â€“ GDP and Oil Consumption, while providing also statistic analysis. Data from a selected country can be saved to database.

This application made by a team of three members for a university project. The other two members of the team took on the tasks of working on the database analysis and design, as well as the documentation of the application. I was responsible for implementing the application's functionality (coding) and user interface (UI) development.
