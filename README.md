# Econometrica
Application that provides data on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries and oil consumption through an API, displaying this information along with its statistical analysis. Additionally, it offers the capability to store data for selected countries.

This application was created by a team of three members for a university project. The other two team members handled the analysis and design of the database, as well as the documentation of the application. I was responsible for developing the code for the functionality and the user interface (UI).
